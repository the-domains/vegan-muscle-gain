I have been vegan for 6 months now. I was pescetarian (I loved sushi, but only ate it occasionally) for almost 5 years prior to that. I started out eating more and more clean for my own health, and as I went along my increasingly plant-powered journey I started learning more about the immense benefits it has on our environment and of course for the animals. Today, I am proudly vegan for the my own health, the environment, and the animals. 

My goals for the next year is to build muscle and strength. I hope to use this platform to hold myself accountable and motivated as I strive to achieve my goals..
