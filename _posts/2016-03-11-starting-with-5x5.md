March 10th 2015 - Workout \#1

After some online searching I found a program that was just what I wanted; a full body workout program with the 5 big compound exercises: Squats, Deadlift, Bench Press, Overhead Press, and Barbell Rows. The program I follow can be found on StrongLifts.com and by downloading complementing app StrongLifts 5x5 (free).

The philosophy is simple, you are lifting to get strong - and by increasing strength you also increase muscle mass. You do three compound exercises, five sets with five reps, three times a week. Squat is always among the three exercises. 

As I haven't been lifting much the past months, I was starting out easy and this is what I did in **todays workout**:

115lb: 5 x 5 - Squat  
95lb:   5 x 5 - Bench Press  
75lb:   5 x 5 - Barbell Rows

I also decided to track my weight every Monday morning, and my weight this Monday was:  
161.8lb (73.4kg)

**Food today (everything organic except for Tofurky)**

* **Breakfast: **  
- 2 x avocado toast with Tofurky slices and tomatoes  
- Smoothie (banana, cocoa powder, dates, hemp seeds, chia seeds, cashew&almond milk)
* **Lunch:**  
- 2 x avocado toast with Tofurky slices and tomatoes
* **Dinner:**  
- Brown rice and curry (coconut milk, sweet potato, tempeh, onion, eggplant, carrot, tomato sauce), with handful cashews  
- Banana chocolate cake
* **Late meal:**  
- Quinoa and curry

I also like to sprinkle nutritional yeast on everything I eat.

That's it for today.
